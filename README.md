# Statistical analysis of NDVI remote sensing data in R
Click this link to learn how to conduct statistical analyses on NDVI data in R: https://polanch190.github.io/ndvi-analysis/

This repository contains an R notebook that uses statistical analyses to understand the relationship between marsh island vegetation density data (NDVI data), mean local sea level rise data, and storm frequency data. In the notebook linked above, learn how to create various plots, conduct normality testing, correlation analysis, and regression analysis in R. The notebook linked above is the second part of a two part anlysis. Click [here](https://github.com/polanch190/GEE-Spatial-Temporal-Analysis-of-Changes-in-Marsh-Vegetation-Density-/blob/main/Color_composite_Image_NB.ipynb) to see how the NDVI data, used in this analysis, was originally extracted.
